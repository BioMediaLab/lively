## Getting started

Run the following command to bootstrap the example

```bash
yarn create yoga
```

Then select the `minimal-yoga` template

```
? Choose a GraphQL server template? 
❯ minimal-yoga (Basic starter template) 
  db-yoga (Template with Prisma database support)
```

Once this is done, `cd` in the created directory, and run

```bash
yarn dev
```

You're good to go,  `yarn dev` will start the server 🙌
